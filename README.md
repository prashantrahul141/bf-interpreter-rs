## Brainf\*ck interpreter in Rust

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. Notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer and an instruction pointer.

Read more about the language on the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

This implementation follows this unofficial language specification : https://github.com/sunjay/brainfuck/blob/master/brainfuck.md
